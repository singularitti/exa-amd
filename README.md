# exa-AMD: Exascale Accelerated Materials Discovery
exa-AMD is a Python framework designed to accelerate the discovery and design of functional materials. The framework uses [Parsl](https://parsl-project.org) to build customizable and automated workflows that connect AI/ML tools, material databases, quantum mechanical calculations, and state-of-the-art computational methods for novel structure prediction. 

exa-AMD is designed to accommodate different workflow styles on high performance computers. It can scale up on supercomputers to use a large number of nodes equipped with accelerators, such as the Nvidia and AMD GPUs. It can also run at a small scale dynamically, coordinating with the queueing system (e.g. Slurm) to automate compute tasks and job submissions. exa-AMD comes with a global registry to support flexible job execution patterns. Users can choose a pre-defined Parsl configuration provided; it is also possible to create a customized Parsl configuration for different computing systems and workflow needs.

- [Examples](#example)

## Prerequisites
This package requires:
- python >= 3.10
- numpy < 2.0
- scikit-learn >= 1.6.1
- pytorch >= 2.2.2
- torchvision >= 0.17.2
- pymatgen >= 2025.3.10
- parsl >= 2025.3.24
- pytest >= 8.3.5
- sphinx >= 7.1.2
- sphinx_rtd_theme >= 3.0.2
- mp-api >= 0.45.7
- python-ternary >= 1.0.8

Additionally:
- Ensure you have a working [VASP](https://www.vasp.at) installation.
- Ensure you have prepared the initial crystal structures in the Crystallographic Information File (CIF) format and put them in a directory called `initial_structures`. An example of an initial data set can be downloaded [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17180192).
- Create a json file that specifies the running configurations for exa-AMD. See for example [configs/chicoma.json](configs/chicoma.json). The configuration file specifies general settings for running exa-AMD, CGCNN, VASP, and the Parsl configuration.


### External packages 
This package contains a modified version of Crystal Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (CGCNN) placed under the `cms_dir` directory. The original [CGCNN](https://github.com/txie-93/cgcnn) source code was developed by [Tian Xie](https://txie.me/) et al., distributed under the MIT License.

## Install
### CLI (preferred)
```bash
pip install "https://github.com/ML-AMD/exa-amd/releases/download/v0.1.0/exa_amd-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl"
exa_amd --help
```
### Conda-only (run from source)
If you use [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) to manage Python packages, you can create the environment using the file included in this repository: [amd_env.yml](./amd_env.yml).
```bash
conda env create -f amd_env.yml
conda activate amd_env
# from the repo root:
python exa_amd.py --config your_config.json
```

## Registering a new Parsl configuration
We currently support the automated workflows on NERSC's Perlmutter and LANL's Chicoma computers. If you would like to run on a different computing system, you must add your own Parsl configuration following these steps:

1. Create a new file in your configs directory (e.g., `parsl_configs/`), similar to the one in [parsl_configs/chicoma.py](parsl_configs/chicoma.py)
2. Add a configuration class with a unique name `<my_parsl_config_name>` 
3. Modify Parsl's execution settings. More details can be found in [Parsl's official documentation](https://parsl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
4. Register your configuration class by calling `register_parsl_config()` inside that file
5. Modify your json configuration file accordingly by setting `parsl_config` to `<my_parsl_config_name>` and `parsl_configs_dir` to the absolute path of your configs directory (e.g., `<abs_path_to>/parsl_configs`)


## Usage (CLI)
- Modify the `initial_structures_dir` field in the json configuration file to indicate the absolute path to the `initial_structures` directory

- Modify the `parsl_configs_dir` field in the json configuration file to indicate the absolute path to the Parsl configurations (e.g., `<abs_path>/parsl_configs`)

- Run exa-AMD with the json file created in the prerequisite step:
    ```bash
    exa_amd --config <your_config_file>
    ```
    For running on Perlmutter for example,
    ```bash
    exa_amd --config configs/perlmutter.json
    ```
- (Optional) The json config file can be overridden via command line arguments, for example:
    ```bash
    exa_amd --config configs/perlmutter.json --num_workers 256
    ```
    For a full list of command line arguments and their descriptions, run:
    ```bash
    exa_amd --help
    ```
